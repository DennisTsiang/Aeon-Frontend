# Aeon

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.
This is the frontend web application for the Aeon system. It should be used in conjuction with the backend server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server running the web app. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Then go to the backend repo and run `node server.js`. 

Web app assumes backend will be running on `localhost:8080`. The host can be changed in `app.component.ts`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Project first requires `npm` to be installed on the machine.

Run `npm install` to install the rest of the dependencies.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
